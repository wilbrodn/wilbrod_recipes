        <h1>Mandazi (African Donuts)</h1>
        <em>These amazingly soft triangle-shaped donuts are very famous in East Africa where I come from. They are excellent with a cup of tea or coffee. The dash of cardamom adds an authentic taste which makes it different from regular donuts. You can serve it with either honey or jam.</em>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup fine white sugar</li>
            <li>1 medium egg</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon saltl</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, sugar, egg, instant yeast, salt, and cardamom in a large bowl. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes together and is easily handled. Knead dough on a flat work surface until no longer sticky.</li>
            <li>Put dough back in the bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm area until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Press dough down gently. Knead it briefly and divide it into 4 portions. Roll each portion into a ball; keep covered with a cloth to prevent them from drying out.</li>
            <li>Roll 1 ball into a 1/3-inch-thick circle on a floured work surface. Cut into 4 triangles using a pizza cutter. Repeat with remaining balls of dough, keeping other dough covered.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium heat. Fry dough triangles 3 or 4 at a time, without overcrowding, until puffed like balloons, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and continue frying until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Serve and Eat</li>
        </ol>
